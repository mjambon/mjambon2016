*************
Requirements:

Caml2html needs an OCaml compiler (>= 3.00) properly installed.
GNU make is required for the compilation.

***********
Compiling:

  make      # try "make byte" if make does not work

Compiling the library (optional):

  make lib  # try "make bytelib" if it does not work


************
Installing the executable:

  make install

The program is installed in the BINDIR
directory specified at the first line of the Makefile (/usr/bin by
default), and is named caml2html (even for bytecode option).

Uninstalling:

  make uninstall


*********
How to run it:

Type "caml2html -help", or have a look at the html documentation 
(caml2html.html).

*********************
Supported platforms:

Caml2html is supposed to work on every Unix platform on which OCaml is
correctly installed. It has been developed under Linux, but works
undoubtedly on any Unix machine.

Please report success or failure on any architecture.

Reported success:
- Linux on x86
- Windows 98 (using ocamake : http://tech.motion-twin.com/?&node=35)
