<h2 id=division>1. Problem division</h2>

<p>
Experience shows that the problem of exchanging, storing and evolving data
would benefit from being split into independent subproblems.

<p>
Although data usually have one canonical way of being thought of,
a variety of technical constraints call for a variety
of data formats and implementations.

<p>
The first problem is therefore to come up with a common language 
for describing data types without relying on features that are 
specific to a particular programming language or data format.

<p>
The second problem is to allow any programming language to join the
party without having to redefine and reimplement the tools for 
describing the data types.

<p>
The third problem is to allow different serialization formats to 
be used to represent the same data.

<p>
Instead of pushing for a supposedly best combination of programming language
and data format, we acknowledge that real-world data will be
represented in different ways by different tools no matter what.
<!-- We are going to present various features of existing data,
programming languages and data formats and how they can all live in harmony
without sacrifices. -->


<h3 id=types>1.1 Ideal types and actuals types</h3>

<p>
After a little bit of thinking and not so much tweaking,
all data can be described using:
<ul>
<li> bool: a type containing two values, usually called true and false,
<li> int: a type representing integers exactly;
<li> float: a type representing real numbers (approximately);
<li> string: a type representing a finite sequence of bytes;
<li> product types: tuples and records/structs;
<li> sum types: variants with 0 or 1 argument, or tagged unions;
<li> list types: sequences of items of a given type;
<li> option types: 0 or 1 element of a given type;
<li> parametrized types, also known as generics or templates;
<li> unit type: type of just one value, useful when using parametrized types;
<li> abstract types: types defined elsewhere but known to the code generators
or interpreters;
<li> inheritance of record fields or variants.
</ul>

<p>
These are the core features allowed by the
ATD syntax (ATD = "Adjustable Type Definitions").
In practice, each programming language may have a choice of different
representations of a particular ATD type. The idea here is to allow annotations
in the ATD file that can be used to specify language-specific options.


<h3 id=languages>1.2 Accomodating multiple programming languages</h3>

<p>
Although the syntax of ATD is strongly based on the syntax of OCaml type
definitions, and although the current tools using ATD are implemented
in OCaml, the target languages can be really anything.
OCaml shines when it comes to processing code and produce more code.
The language of the input code here is ATD but the output can be anything:
OCaml code, Java code, JSON, HTML documentation, etc.

<p>
It is of course possible to reimplement the tools of the <code>atd</code>
package in another programming language at a reasonable cost, that is maybe
a few weeks to months of work for a clean job,
but this is not expected to happen anytime soon.
Using the <code>atd</code> library for building code generators
for other languages than OCaml makes perfect sense and is something
OCaml is suited for.
To date at MyLife we have been using the following tools all based on ATD 
type specifications:
<ul>
<li> OCaml readers and writers for JSON generated using 
<a href="#atdgen"><code>atdgen</code></a> and using  
<a href="#yojson"><code>yojson</code></a> for runtime support,
<li> Java readers and writers for JSON.
<li> and a few other validation tools and code generators used privately.
</ul>


<h3 id=formats>1.3 Accomodating multiple data formats</h3>

<p>
A variety of data formats (JSON, XML, etc.) can be used and data
types can be specified using ATD.
The ATD syntax allows for annotations in various places which
make it possible to adjust the basic ATD type definition to the idioms
of the target language.

<!--
<p>
Although this has not been implemented, one can imagine that 
various conventions to map ATD record types and variant types to XML.
A code generator producing XML readers and writers would use
one specific convention by default, by the presence of annotations
could override the default convention.
-->

<h2 id=tools>2. Tools</h2>

<p>
Several tools that make the ATD language relevant will be released
around the same time.
This is a list of features that these tools offer.

<h3 id=atd>2.1 ATD</h3>

<p>
<code>atd</code>
is the OCaml library providing a parser for the ATD language
and various utilities. ATD stands for Adjustable Type Definitions
in reference to its main property of supporting annotations
that allow a good fit with a variety of data formats.

    <span class="Ccomment">(* Optional field without a default value. *)</span>

  tree : int tree<span class="Cnonalphakeyword">;</span>
<span class="Cnonalphakeyword">}</span></pre>

<p>
The <code>atd</code> package provides:
<ul>
<li> Parser for the ATD syntax, consisting in
     <a href="#types">type definitions</a>.
<li> Expander of inherited fields or variants.
<li> Monomorphizer, useful for producing optimized code or 
     for mapping to languages that do not support parametrized types.
<li> Simple indentation utility.
<li> Annotation processing utilities.
<li> Pretty-printer of ATD definitions.
<li> <code>atdcat</code>, a program that reads type definitions, optionally
applies inheritance or monomorphization, and prints them back.
</ul>

<p>
An interesting use of ATD annotations is that <code>&lt;doc text=...&gt;</code>
nodes can be used to specify comments applicable to the generated code.
Such comments can be interpreted by the code generators
converted into ocamldoc-compliant or javadoc-compliant
comments, allowing the production of quality
HTML documentation.


<h3 id=yojson>2.2 Yojson</h3>

<p>
<a href="yojson.html">Yojson</a> is an optimized parser/printer 
and pretty-printer for <a href="http://json.org/">JSON</a>.
It addresses a few limitations of 
<a href="/json-wheel.html"><code>json-wheel</code></a>
and provides a number of low-level runtime functions 
on which code generated by 
<code>atdgen</code> hooks up.

<p>
The main differences with <code>json-wheel</code> are:
<ul>
<li> Uses polymorphic variants for the JSON tree type,
which reduces interpackage dependencies
and makes extensions easier.
<li> By default tolerates convenient non-standard JSON features: NaNs,
infinities, root atoms, unquoted field names.
<li> Optional, extended syntax for tuples and variants.
</ul>

<h3 id=biniou>2.3 Biniou</h3>

<p>
<a href="biniou.html">Biniou</a> (pronounced "be new")
is a new binary format vastly equivalent to JSON since it has the
following properties:
<ul>
<li> all data can be visualized in pretty-printed JSON-like text
form without a type definition (except
for field names and variant names);
<li> record fields can be omitted if the data consumer knows the default value;
<li> unknown record field names can be ignored by the data consumer;
<li> the order of record fields does not matter;
<li> the order in which record fields or variants are defined 
in type definitions does not matter;
<li> new record fields can be freely added to type definitions
by the data producers ahead of the consumers;
<li> new variants can be freely added to type definitions 
by the data consumers ahead of the producers.
</ul>

<p>
Field names and variant names are represented using 31-bit hashes like
method names and polymorphic variants in OCaml.

<p>
Strings have no encoding requirement and are stored without any escaping.

<p>
Arrays of records can be represented using a specific representation 
called tables. A table does not repeat field information shared
by all its records, resulting in space gains.


<p>
Biniou data typically take 25-30% less space than their JSON equivalent.
<code>biniou</code> is the OCaml package that provides optimized readers,
writers and pretty-printers for the biniou format.
The library also provides the runtime functions used by the code 
generated by <a href="#atdgen"><code>atdgen</code></a>,
as well as the buffer types used by <code>yojson</code>.


<h3 id=atdgen>2.4 Atdgen</h3>

<p>
<a href="/atdgen"><code>atdgen</code></a> 
is a program that generates optimized OCaml code
for reading and writing either biniou or JSON data.
Generated code directly converts
between byte buffers and the desired OCaml representation without
going through a generic tree like 
<a href="json-static.html">json-static</a> does.

<p>
Benchmarks performed on an amd64-Linux machine for combined reading
and writing show that:
<ul>
<li> <code>atdgen-json</code> produces code that is 3 times faster than 
json-static but 4 times slower than <code>atdgen-biniou</code>.
<li> Code generated by <code>atdgen-biniou</code> is 2-3 times slower than
OCaml's Marshal.
</ul>
