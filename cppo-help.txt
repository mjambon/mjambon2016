            #endext

          NAME must be a lowercase identifier of the form [a-z][A-Za-z0-9_]*

          CMD_TEMPLATE is a command template supporting the following
          special sequences:
            %F  file name (unescaped; beware of potential scripting attacks)
            %B  number of the first line
            %E  number of the last line
            %%  a single percent sign

          Filename, first line number and last line number are also
          available from the following environment variables:
          CPPO_FILE, CPPO_FIRST_LINE, CPPO_LAST_LINE.

          The command produced is expected to read the data lines from stdin
          and to write its output to stdout.
