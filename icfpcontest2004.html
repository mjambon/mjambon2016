<p>
I participated in the 7th edition of the 
<a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/proj/plclub/contest">ICFP 
programming contest</a>, 
in June 2004.

<p>
The name of my one-member team was ANTisocial.
You can get my 
<a href="icfpcontest2004/submission-ANTisocial.tar.gz">final submission</a>. 
However,
It has a last minute bug in the "wait" function, 
that I fixed in 
<a href="icfpcontest2004/submission-ANTisocial.fixed.tar.gz">this version</a>.


<h2>The ant generator</h2>

<p>
I wrote OCaml functions that let me define what I called
subtasks. I defined several higher order functions that manipulate
subtasks: or, and, not, xor, while, until, if, ifnot, ifelse, 
return, fail, choose, sequence, switch
(<a href="icfpcontest2004/lib.ml">lib.ml</a>).
Then the job was to use these instructions to make my colony work
correctly.
The source code for my ant is in the file 
<a href="icfpcontest2004/work.ml">work.ml</a>.
It it 2 times shorter than the output, has blank lines, and about 20
lines of dead code (function <code>incr_mark</code>).


<h2>Strategy</h2>

<p>
The strategy I chose is based on:
<ul>
<li> tracing 6 straight oriented lines that start from the corners 
of the anthill, using 3 markers,
<li> protecting the corners with 5 guards, so that no enemy can take 
food from these places that have a high probability of containing food since
<li> when an ant has found some food, it will follow 
the line that brings it directly to (a corner of) 
its anthill as soon as possible.
</ul>
<p>
This is better illustrated by the position of the markers, as shown in
this <a href="icfpcontest2004/world.mred">map</a>. 
Note that an additional marker 4
is located on each corner but is 
not visible since there is already a marker 0.
<p>
The final (fixed) ant is <a href="icfpcontest2004/work.ant">here</a>.


<h2>Various outputs</h2>


<h3>Profiling</h3>

<p>
The <a href="icfpcontest2004/red.stats">number of accesses to each state</a>
is output and sorted after each 
simulation. I think that a healthy brain is one that has a balanced
number of accesses to each node. Note that the ants use a collective
brain. 100,000 simulation steps were performed with initially 91 red ants.
The most accessed node corresponds to the 30 food guards, that simply
do nothing once they decided to be guards (the "loop" state).

<h3>Graphs</h3>

<p>
I displayed the transitions between the states of my ants with the dot
tool from the Graphviz package. The graph for 
<a href="icfpcontest2004/work.ant">my ant</a> is available
as a <a href="icfpcontest2004/work.png">PNG image</a>, 
or better as a 
<a href="icfpcontest2004/work-larger.ps">PostScript file</a> (or its 
<a href="icfpcontest2004/work.ps">compact version</a>).
The gv tool is convenient for watching this kind of files.
