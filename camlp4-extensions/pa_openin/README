openin:  local open of module in expressions
Alain Frisch  <Alain.Frisch@ens.fr>


This package implements a Camlp4 syntax extension for Objective Caml.
It adds the syntactic construction

    open M in e

that can appear in any context where an expression is expected. 
M is a (qualified) module name and e is an expression.


There is also a more general construction

   struct ... end in e

where ... is a sequence of structure item (type, exception, class declarations;
open; ...).


To compile the syntax extension:

ocamlc -c -pp 'camlp4o pa_extend.cmo q_MLast.cmo' -I +camlp4 pa_openin.ml

Then you can install pa_openin.cmo in your .../lib/ocaml/camlp4 directory,
and use it:

ocamlc -c -pp 'camlp4o pa_openin.cmo' myfile.ml


The code is in public domain.
