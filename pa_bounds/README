                  pa_bounds syntax extension
                  ==========================

What it provides: 
----------------
The default behavior of out-of-bounds array, string or bigarray accesses 
is to raise the Invalid_argument exception, with no information on where
the faulty access was attempted.
This Camlp4 module provides a special syntax which allows the illegal 
accesses to be reported accurately, by indicating the location
in the source code. The same exception, Invalid_argument, is raised, but
its argument is a string which contains that information.

The syntax:
----------
Replace the dot (.) by the number sign (#), e.g.:

    native             extension
    a.(i)              a#(i)
    a.(i) <- e         a#(i) <- e
    s.[i]              s#[i]
    s.[i] <- c         s#[i] <- c
    big.{i,j}          big#{i,j}
    big.{i,j} <- x     big#{i,j} <- x

It should also work with the revised syntax, where ":=" replaces "<-".

Options:
-------

-native
  The native behavior can be restored without changing the program by
  passing the -native option to the preprocessor. For unsafe access 
  without bound checking, this option must be used in addition to the
  -unsafe option that can be passed to the compiler (ocamlopt or ocamlc).

Installation:
------------
Install Findlib and P4ck, and then install it from P4ck.
Alternatively, you can compile the extension as follows:
  camlp4o -o ocamlc -c \
         -pp 'camlp4o pa_extend.cmo q_MLast.cmo -loc _loc' \
         -I +camlp4 pa_bounds.ml

information on how to compile programs that use Camlp4 extensions.
